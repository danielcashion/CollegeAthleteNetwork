            At The College Athlete Network, we believe in empowering college
            athletes to succeed beyond the field, court, or track. Our journey
            began when we noticed a glaring problem: universities were relying
            on outdated, manual processes to connect their athletes with alumni
            for career opportunities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-center md:text-left">
            We saw an opportunity to make a difference. By introducing a
            professional workflow, we&apos;ve taken the burden of maintaining
            and updating these networks off the shoulders of university
            administrations and placed it in the hands of a trusted partner â€”
            us.
