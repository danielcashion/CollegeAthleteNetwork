        <p>Hi {{First Name}},</p>
        <p>Your next opportunity could come from someone who wore the same jersey. Our University's Athlete Network is stronger than others because we have a great process using The College Athlete Network. Here's how to tap into it:</p>
        <h2>Step 1: Login & Create Your "Availability" on our network at <a style="color:#ED3237;" href="https://members.collegeathletenetwork.org">www.collegeathletenetwork.org</a> </h2>
        <p>First, tell us if you are looking. Then tell us what you're looking for—job interests, location, goals. It only takes a minute.</p>
        <h2>Step 2: Your Department Tracks Progress</h2>
        <p>Your coaches and staff are making sure every athlete gets the same shot. When your checklist is done, we will engage with you to start matching you with our network opportunities.</p>
        <h2>Step 3: Coaches Activate the Network</h2>
        <p>Once checklists are complete, coaches give the green light—and your Availability goes live to our University's +5,000 athlete network.</p>
        <h2>Step 4: Opportunities Come to You</h2>
        <p>Alumni and our Corporate Partners check out the Network to find athletes just like you. If there's a match, they'll reach out.</p>
        <h2>Step 5: Career Connections Happen</h2>
        <p>This is where the magic happens—real jobs, real people, real momentum.</p>
        <h2>Step 6: Your Program Gets Paid</h2>
        <p>When you get hired, the hiring company can make a contribution back to our athletic program— we typically guidance is 25% of what they would've paid a recruiter.</p>
        <p>You're not just building your future. You're helping the next generation of our athletes too.</p>

        <p>Hi {{First Name}},</p>
        <p>We've made it easy—and meaningful—for you to hire exceptional talent from your alma mater's athlete network. Here's how it works:</p>
        <h2>Step 1: Athletes &amp; Alums Share Their Availabilities</h2>
        <p>Current and former athletes create short profiles with their career interests, goals, locations, and time frames.</p>
        <h2>Step 2: The Athletic Department Curates Participation</h2>
        <p>Coaches and AD staff encourages the athletes to keep their Availability status up-to-date—no guesswork.</p>
        <h2>Step 3: The Network Goes Live</h2>
        <p>As athletes complete their checklists & Availabilities, the network of athlete Availabilities continues to match our athletes with great oppotunities within our network.</p>
        <h2>Step 4: You Match Opportunities to Talent</h2>
        <p>Search by industry, company, or location—and connect with highly motivated athletes ready for the next step.</p>
        <h2>Step 5: Everyone Wins</h2>
        <p>You get trusted, high-character hires without paying large recruiter fees!</p>
        <h2>Step 6: You Pay It Forward</h2>
        <p>Instead of paying a recruiter, you make a tax-deductible contribution to the athletic program that produced your new hire. It's a win for your company and a win for your team.</p>
        <p>No external recruiter fees. No friction. Just real connections—with purpose.</p>
