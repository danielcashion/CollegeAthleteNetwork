        <p>Dear {{First Name}},</p>
        <p>Your next career opportunity could come from someone who wore the same jersey. {{Your University Name}} has partnered with The College Athlete Network to create a structured, professional network that connects current athletes and alumni with meaningful career opportunities.</p>
        <p>Here's how our network works:</p>
        <h2>Step 1: Create Your Availability Profile</h2>
        <p>Visit <a style="color:#ED3237;" href="https://members.collegeathletenetwork.org">members.collegeathletenetwork.org</a> to create your Availability profile. Share your career interests, preferred locations, and professional goals. The process takes just a few minutes.</p>
        <h2>Step 2: Complete Your Checklist</h2>
        <p>Your athletic department monitors your progress to ensure every athlete has equal access to opportunities. Once you complete your checklist, we'll begin matching you with relevant opportunities in our network.</p>
        <h2>Step 3: Your Profile Goes Live</h2>
        <p>After your checklist is complete, coaches activate your profile, making it visible to our University's network of over 5,000 athletes and alumni.</p>
        <h2>Step 4: Connect with Opportunities</h2>
        <p>Alumni and corporate partners actively search the network to find qualified candidates. When there's a match with your profile, they'll reach out directly.</p>
        <h2>Step 5: Build Your Career</h2>
        <p>Connect with real opportunities from real people—alumni and corporate partners who value the discipline, leadership, and work ethic that athletes bring to the workplace.</p>
        <h2>Step 6: Support Future Athletes</h2>
        <p>When you're hired through the network, the hiring company makes a tax-deductible contribution to our athletic program—typically 25% of what they would have paid a recruiter. You're not just building your future; you're investing in the next generation of {{Your University Name}} athletes.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Search and Connect</h2>
        <p>Use our search filters to find candidates by industry, location, or experience level. Connect directly with highly motivated athletes ready for their next opportunity.</p>
        <h2>Step 5: Make Your Hire</h2>
